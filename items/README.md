## ‚ú®üóëÔ∏è Item clustering (fallen blocks, experience orbs, ...) and garbage cleanup

Sometimes there are a lot of items lying around in the world which are not picked up by the user or not used at all.
In most cases these are clustered together but they could easily exceed the limit if you are mining and not picking up the items.
The mod automatically try to cluster them further and cleanup items on a regular basis starting with the oldest one and adjust the lifespan based on the server load.
This helps dramatically to allow greater TNT explosions because most of the trashed items are removed after reaching a certain limit.

Experience Orbs could cause a lag from bigger monster farms or if they are not picked up.
They will be automatically clustered in a specific range and combine the experience values.
These optimization happens on the server side without introducing any new custom items.
