![Adaptive Performance Tweaks: Mods][header]

Adaptive Performance Tweaks is a collection of Minecraft Forge server-side Mod which automatically adjust specific settings on the server to allow a more balanced TPS/FPS.
The goal of this mod is to allow a smoother experience on a server with several (=> 180) Mods.

## Please read before using

This mod is renaming / moving your mod files, for this reason it is important that you have regular backups in place.
I will do my best to implement corresponding safety features to avoid possible issues, but I'm not able to cover all use cases.

## 👾Automatic Server Bundle (one mod pack for client/server)

This mod automatically disable mods which are incompatible or not needed on the server side.
There is no need to have a separated "server" and "client" mod pack only for the mods.

## 👾 Automatic Mod Cleanup

This mod automatically clean up duplicated files, by moving older versions in an archive folder.
This is helpful to avoid manual deleting of older versions.
