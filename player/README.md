## 🛡️Player Login Optimization and Protection

Sometimes it takes up to 30sec until the player is able to interact with the world after he is logged in.
This mod automatically protects the user for the time between login and to be able to interactive with the world to make sure that he is not attacked by mobs during this time.
Furthermore other smaller optimization will be done to allow a smoother login process.

## 🛡️🐨Child Player Protection

Changes the game-mode of your Child automatically to a more peaceful / easier mode so that they are more enjoying the game even if you are playing in another mode like hardcore.
