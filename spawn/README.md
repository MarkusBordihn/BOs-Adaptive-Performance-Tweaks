![Adaptive Performance Tweaks: Spawn][header]

Adaptive Performance Tweaks is a collection of Minecraft Forge server-side Mod which automatically adjust specific settings on the server to allow a more balanced TPS/FPS.
The goal of this mod is to allow a smoother experience on a server with several (=> 180) Mods.

## üëæOptimized Mob Spawn Calculations

Mob spawns are limited to a specific view area of the player which allows a better distribution and lowers the numbers of entities without a visible effect for the user.
_Example: If you are walking on the surface entities below a specific distance / which are currently not reachable mobs will not be spawn until you are closer to them._

## üëªSpawn Control

The mod includes a basic spawn control to define the max. number of entity types per player and world with some predefined settings for specific mods.
This includes a deny and allow list to disable specific mobs completely or to exclude them from the optimization.

The spawn-rate is calculated on the following formula:

```math
Number Of players * Max Number Of Entity * Server Load * Game Difficulty
```

**Note: Playing in the game difficulty HARD could exceed the max number of hostile entity from the config file by max. 1.5x.**

You could also get an overview of all currently loaded monster over `/aptweaks monster`.

## üì¶Spawner Optimization (wip)

Keeps track of the current number of loaded spawner and perform smaller optimization.
You could also get an overview of all currently loaded spawners over `/aptweaks spawner`.
