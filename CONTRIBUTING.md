# Contributing

Want to contribute? Great! First, read this page. We follow a code of conduct as our guide for
community behavior.

## Before you contribute

Before we can use your code, you must sign the [Individual Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md)
(CLA), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the
copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our
codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also
need to be sure of various other things -- for instance that you'll tell us if
you know that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to
sign the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has
approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.
Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with
us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and
possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.
